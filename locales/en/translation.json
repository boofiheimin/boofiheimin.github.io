    "pptDescription" : "On the blissful night of December 27th 2019 an angel was bestowed upon us. This sweet & shy angel is called Amane Kanata. She is an unquestionably determined g̶o̶r̶i̶l̶l̶a̶  angel. She’s been through countless ups and downs, the road wasn’t always a steady one. However, we’re finally here… 1 Million Heimins, 1 Million Subscribers. It has been a long and wild journey, yet an amusing and worthwhile one. Whether it’s her debut, cover songs, 3D, Undertale, Minecraft, and much much more. The way she handled all the challenges just shows how relentless she is. Nothing could stop her, as she soars through the skies of heaven as bright as the stars and as high as anyone can see.This milestone marks a new beginning, a new Amane Kanata, one that will rise higher, shine brighter, and of course bring happiness and joy to more people. It’s time for her to fly higher and reach a place no one has ever reached before. #(insert the 1mil hashtag here)",
